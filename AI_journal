 Week 1
This week I used AI briefly to brainstorm topics for our project. The topics suggested were vague, and our team thought of topics ourselves.

At the end of week 1, I completed the exercise assigned to us.  They were fairly standard python problems, but for the last one I did not fully understand the question.
I asked ChatGPT for more clarification, and it provided me with some helpful insight. I then solved the question and asked it to double check my answer.

Week 2
Now week 2 of this class is wrapping up, I finished week 2 exercises with some assistance from AI. These concepts are proving to be more difficult than last week, but I was able to figure out the logic behind these problems. On question 26 I asked ChatGPT for some assistance to help me figure out the problem. It gave me some good feedback, and I was able to solve it.

Week 3
This week for class the concepts are starting to get harder and now we’re working on functions. I was stumped fairly fast on exercise 2, and asked ChatGPT on how to solve this problem. It gave me some helpful feedback, and I was able to solve the problem and use that information to solve later exercises.

Week 4
Now we’re starting to learn about API calls in functions in Python. To build our app we have to make some functions to retrieve data, so I asked ChatGPT to help explain how API calls work and how every line functions in the code. It was very helpful to break it down into bits I can understand, and now I have a better grasp on how API calls function.

Week 5
This week we’re learning about encapsulation and data hiding. For these exercises I used AI to explain data security concepts in object-oriented programming. From validating data to normalizing it, ChatGPT was a helpful tool in understanding how to do these exercises. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/c/68e92b0d-556c-832c-810f-5369f6f3e1fb
