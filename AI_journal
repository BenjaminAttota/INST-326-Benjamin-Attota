 Week 1
This week I used AI briefly to brainstorm topics for our project. The topics suggested were vague, and our team thought of topics ourselves.

At the end of week 1, I completed the exercise assigned to us.  They were fairly standard python problems, but for the last one I did not fully understand the question.
I asked ChatGPT for more clarification, and it provided me with some helpful insight. I then solved the question and asked it to double check my answer.

Week 2
Now week 2 of this class is wrapping up, I finished week 2 exercises with some assistance from AI. These concepts are proving to be more difficult than last week, but I was able to figure out the logic behind these problems. On question 26 I asked ChatGPT for some assistance to help me figure out the problem. It gave me some good feedback, and I was able to solve it.

Week 3
This week for class the concepts are starting to get harder and now weâ€™re working on functions. I was stumped fairly fast on exercise 2, and asked ChatGPT on how to solve this problem. It gave me some helpful feedback, and I was able to solve the problem and use that information to solve later exercises.
