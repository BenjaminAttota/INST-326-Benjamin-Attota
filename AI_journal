Week 1
This week I used AI briefly to brainstorm topics for our project. The topics suggested were vague, and our team thought of topics ourselves.

At the end of week 1, I completed the exercise assigned to us.  They were fairly standard python problems, but for the last one I did not fully understand the question.
I asked ChatGPT for more clarification, and it provided me with some helpful insight. I then solved the question and asked it to double check my answer.

Week 2
Now week 2 of this class is wrapping up, I finished week 2 exercises with some assistance from AI. These concepts are proving to be more difficult than last week, but I was able to figure out the logic behind these problems. On question 26 I asked ChatGPT for some assistance to help me figure out the problem. It gave me some good feedback, and I was able to solve it.

Week 3
This week for class the concepts are starting to get harder and now we’re working on functions. I was stumped fairly fast on exercise 2, and asked ChatGPT on how to solve this problem. It gave me some helpful feedback, and I was able to solve the problem and use that information to solve later exercises.

Week 4
Now we’re starting to learn about API calls in functions in Python. To build our app we have to make some functions to retrieve data, so I asked ChatGPT to help explain how API calls work and how every line functions in the code. It was very helpful to break it down into bits I can understand, and now I have a better grasp on how API calls function.

Week 5
This week we’re learning about encapsulation and data hiding. For these exercises I used AI to explain data security concepts in object-oriented programming. From validating data to normalizing it, ChatGPT was a helpful tool in understanding how to do these exercises. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/c/68e92b0d-556c-832c-810f-5369f6f3e1fb

Week 6
In this week the exercises assigned to us were about methods and class design. I asked AI to help me understand the concepts behind this weeks problems. Specifically, exercise 5 I asked ChatGPT to explain the class methods that return preset policies. It was able to explain how to code it and gave an even more in-depth explanation when asked.

Week 7
The exercises this week are going over error handling and testing. The problems we were given also had starter helpers to help us get thought these problems. I asked ChatGPT for an explanation on how to properly implement this starter data, and it gave me a thorough guide on how to use it and if I wanted it to dive deeper into other related concepts. AI has been really helpful in debugging and helping me understand code in plain English. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/c/6907f51e-3db0-8332-8eed-0f5b5aa54aab

Week 8
Now starting the process on Project 3, My team and I are looking at the exercises to get understanding for our information retrieval project we are using AI for ideas and for getting a rough draft on our code. I also asked Claude for help on exercise 14 which is drafting a hierarchy diagram. Here is the chat link: https://claude.ai/chat/e37e6530-f881-42b6-9e4f-2c04d4e93d47

Week 9
This week for my exercises, I had ChatGPT help me explain how to use the starter scaffolding to help me with my exercises. It gave a great explanation on how to use the starter code, and I got examples from it. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/c/691a4912-9178-832e-b70c-66b21ce0790f

Week 10
This week in our exercises we mostly focused on exercises from the Library Management domain going through these exercises I asked ChatGPT to help me understand these exercises and possible ways to solve them. It gave multiple solutions to my problems and gave some great feedback on how to incorporate this into my learning. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/c/691fe9e1-fa18-8330-ae4a-96edcf649033

Week 12
This week we have been working on our project 4 for our final project. I personally didn’t use AI this week but I have been communicating with my group project classmates to finalize details and look over our final product
