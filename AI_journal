 Week 1
This week I used AI briefly to brainstorm topics for our project. The topics suggested were vague, and our team thought of topics ourselves. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/c/68c2fae6-2044-8330-a165-9799b6a834a0

At the end of week 1, I completed the exercise assigned to us.  They were fairly standard python problems, but for the last one I did not fully understand the question. I asked ChatGPT for more clarification, and it provided me with some helpful insight. I then solved the question and asked it to double check my answer.
